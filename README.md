## Demo
Here is a working live demo : [https://buttons-components.vercel.app/](https://buttons-components.vercel.app/)

## General info
This project is a challenge front-end, part of the challenges proposed by the website "https://devchallenges.io/"

This project is not a component library, I created this project in order to learn how to use the "Styled components" and "Prop Types" libraries. It was interesting to develop this project, based on the props I define the styles of the buttons, the main component handles props by default and I verify if they are valid.
  
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* React ("v17.0.2")
* Prop-Types: ("v15.7.2")
* Styled-Components: ("v5.3.0")
